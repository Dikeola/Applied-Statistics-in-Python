#Large P-Value like; 0.531 for Prob(F-Statistic) will indicate the lack of support for covariance affecting the model.
#The individual p-values of the independent variable and the covariate will determine the level of influence each has on the dependent variable;
a large p-value means not a significant predictor of the dependent variable.
